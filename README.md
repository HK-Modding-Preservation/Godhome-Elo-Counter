# Godhome Elo Counter

A Hollow Knight mod that adds an ELO system to Godhome.

## Why ELO over simply tracking wins/losses?

ELO is way more volatile than a winrate. When tracking winrate, you'll always be slow down by the amount of losses you have. The more you lose, the harder it is to make your winrate go up. You could win 10 games in a row and it could not affect your winrate at all. With ELO, the more you win, the harder it is to gain ELO and the higher ELO you are, the more you will lose on defeat.

So if you play well, you go up fast. If you play badly, you go down fast.

## The benefits

The key points of using ELO are:

#### Consistency

If you want to get a high ELO, you'll have to be more consistent on your wins. Something that happens when you don't track stats is just not caring. You take a dumb hit and say "Oh, I was not focused, not my fault", but if you train for harder challenges, you don't care about being focused or not. What you care about is winning.

#### Self control

Challenges on this game can put a lot of pressure on you. Fights during training are very different from running challenges. At some point, losses will have a huge impact on your ELO, and if you care about it, you'll be able to play with constant panic and train self-control.
