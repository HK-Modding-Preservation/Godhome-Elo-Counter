# Godhome Elo Counter

_A Hollow Knight mod that introduces an ELO rating system to Godhome, enhancing your gameplay experience by tracking performance and encouraging improvement._

## 📈 Why Use ELO Instead of Just Tracking Wins/Losses?

ELO offers a more dynamic and responsive metric compared to winrate. Unlike winrate, which can be heavily influenced by past losses and becomes harder to improve over time, ELO adjusts based on your current performance:

- **Rapid Progression:** If you play well, your ELO increases quickly.
- **High Stakes:** As your ELO rises, gains become harder to achieve, and losses have a greater impact.

ELO reflects your _current skill level_ and adjusts to your performance, making it a more accurate and rewarding system for tracking improvement.

## 🎯 Benefits of Using ELO

### 🔁 Consistency

Striving for a high ELO demands consistent performance. It encourages you to approach each fight with focus and determination, even during training. No more shrugging off mistakes as "just a fluke"—every match matters.

### 🧠 Self-Control

Challenges in Hollow Knight can be intense. With ELO, every win and loss affects your rating. This adds pressure, pushing you to master self-control and thrive under difficult conditions, skills that are invaluable in real gameplay.
